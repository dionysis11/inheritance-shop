## Project Overview
This project is designed to simulate a basic item borrowing system, where various types of items (Book, Ang, Buy, Movie, Song, Speakers, VideoGame) can be borrowed by individuals. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. The system is built by students using Java and simulates borrowing behavior with random selection of items and people.
